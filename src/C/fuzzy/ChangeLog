	  Nobody was using it.
	* Ammended API functions to support hashing either a buffer
	  or an open file handle
	* Moved ssdeep code into engine.c, moved fuzzy hashing
	  code into fuzzy.c. This will help us create libfuzzy
	  and fuzzy.dll.
	* Lots of cleanup to fuzzy hashing code. This includes removing
	  types like 'uchar' and replacing them with C99 types like
	  unsigned char. Less work for mother means less work debugging.
	* Moved definition of __progname to ssdeep.h. It's not being
	  used by the fuzzy hashing library and caused problems on OS X.
	* Brought over code to support Unicode from Miss Identify
	* Version bump to 2.0 beta1
	* Added sample program to demonstrate API features
