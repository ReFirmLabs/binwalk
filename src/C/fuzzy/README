**** FUZZY HASHING API ****

This file documents the fuzzy hashing API. Information on how to use the
fuzzy hashing program ssdeep can be found in the man page. On *nix
systems you can view this file with:

$ man ./ssdeep.1

Windows users can get the ssdeep usage information from README.TXT.


** Using the API in Your Own Progrms **

You can use the fuzzy hashing API in your own programs by doing 
the following:

1. Include the fuzzy hashing header

#include <fuzzy.h>


2. Call one of the functions:

* Fuzzy hashing a buffer of text:

int fuzzy_hash_buf(const unsigned char *buf,
		   uint32_t      buf_len,
	           char          *result);

This function computes the fuzzy hash of the buffer 'buf' and stores the
result in result. You MUST allocate result to hold FUZZY_MAX_RESULT
characters before calling this function. The length of the buffer should
be passed in via buf_len. It is the user's responsibility to append the
filename, if any, to the output. The function returns zero on success,
one on error.


* Fuzzy hashing a file:

There are in fact two ways to fuzzy hash a file. If you already 
have an open file handle you can use:

int fuzzy_hash_file(FILE *handle,
	            char *result);

This function computes the fuzzy hash of the file pointed to by handle
and stores the result in result. You MUST allocate result to hold
FUZZY_MAX_RESULT characters before calling this function. It is the 
user's responsibility to append the filename to the output. 
The function returns zero on success, one on error.

The other function to hash a file takes a file name:

int fuzzy_hash_filename(const char * filename,
			char * result);

Like the function above, this function stores the fuzzy hash result
in the parameter result. You MUST allocate result to hold 
FUZZY_MAX_RESULT characters before calling this function.


* Compare two fuzzy hash signatures:

int fuzzy_compare(const char *sig1, const char *sig2);

This function returns a value from 0 to 100 indicating the match 
score of the two signatures. A match score of zero indicates the \
sigantures did not match.


3. Compile

To compile the program using gcc:

   $ gcc -Wall -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib sample.c -Lfuzzy

Using mingw:

   C:\> gcc -Wall -Ic:\path\to\includes sample.c fuzzy.dll

Using Microsoft Visual C (MSVC):

To paraphrase the MinGW documentation, 
http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-msvcdll:

The Windows ssdeep package includes a Win32 DLL and a .def file. Although
MSVC users can't use the DLL directly, they can easily create a .lib file
using the Microsoft LIB tool:

   C:\> lib /machine:i386 /def:fuzzy.def

You can then compile your program using the resulting library:

   C:\> cl sample.c fuzzy.lib



** Sample Program **
 
A sample program that uses the API is in sample.c.
