class BlockFile(io.FileIO):
	'''
	Abstraction class for accessing binary files.

	This class overrides io.FilIO's read and write methods. This guaruntees two things:

		1. All requested data will be read/written via the read and write methods.
		2. All reads return a str object and all writes can accept either a str or a
		   bytes object, regardless of the Python interpreter version.

	However, the downside is that other io.FileIO methods won't work properly in Python 3,
	namely things that are wrappers around self.read (e.g., readline, readlines, etc).

	This class also provides a read_block method, which is used by binwalk to read in a
	block of data, plus some additional data (MAX_TRAILING_SIZE), but on the next block read
	pick up at the end of the previous data block (not the end of the additional data). This
	is necessary for scans where a signature may span a block boundary.

	The descision to force read to return a str object instead of a bytes object is questionable
	for Python 3, it seemed the best way to abstract differences in Python 2/3 from the rest
	of the code (especially for people writing plugins) and to add Python 3 support with 
	minimal code change.
	'''

	# The MAX_TRAILING_SIZE limits the amount of data available to a signature.
	# While most headers/signatures are far less than this value, some may reference 
	# pointers in the header structure which may point well beyond the header itself.

	# significantly slow the scan; this value represents a reasonable buffer size to
	# pass to libmagic which will not drastically affect scan time.
